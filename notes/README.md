# Data Structures

- I need to become more familiar with the different data structures in order to become more successful in solving algorithmic problems, so this section of the repo is focused mainly on the different basic data structures that are key to understanding more complex structures and algorithms. 

**Data Structures**

- Complex data structures such as trees, dynamic arrays, queues, graphs, hashtables, are all created by building blocks of static array and linked lists. 
- For example, a linked list structure is built using a node
- For example, dynamic arrays uses static array for its implementation
- For trees, it also uses node structure for its implementation

**Abstract Data Type (ADT)** 
* is the logical model representing real life structures, e.g priority queue, it's an ADT and so it has multiple ways to implement the structure, you can use binary heaps, or you can even use other data structure to implement it as long as you have a way to make sure the implementation will enable priority to be set for each element.
* it defines the types behavior our implemention should include
